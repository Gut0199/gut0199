<h1>Hello üëã, nice to meet you ü§ù, my name's Jos√© Augusto and I'm more one of a "coffee <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/java/java-original.svg" width="40px" />" addict!</h1>
<h3>Jokes aside, it's a pleasure to have you here on my profile. As I'm still an "Aspiring" programmer, you're very likely to find some very "Peculiar" and "Noob" things here üòâ.</h3>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Just a Brazilian boy, trying to follow his dream of one day working in computing. Since I was younger, I've always loved computer games, videogames and cell phones, it was then that I started to become more interested in the subject of development of both devices and games. Today more "experienced", I continue in search of this dream but with a different focus. Today I'm totally focused on the Back-end area, on developing features, dealing with errors, dealing with sending and receiving data, "Making things work" so to speak.</p>

<h3>About My Skill's:</h3>
<p>I'm a JAVA student, but I had a quick introduction to Python (just the basics), I also learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS too. However, I am more focused on studying JAVA using JDBC and JPA with Spring and Hibernate along with MySQL and MongoDB. </p>
