<h1>Hello 👋, nice to meet you 🤝, my name's José Augusto and I'm more one of a "coffee <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/java/java-original.svg" width="40px" />" addict!</h1>
<h3>Jokes aside, it's a pleasure to have you here on my profile. As I'm still an "Aspiring" programmer, you're very likely to find some very "Peculiar" and "Noob" things here 😉.</h3>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Just a Brazilian boy, trying to follow his dream of one day working in computing. Since I was younger, I've always loved computer games, videogames and cell phones, it was then that I started to become more interested in the subject of development of both devices and games. Today more "experienced", I continue in search of this dream but with a different focus. Today I'm totally focused on the Back-end area, on developing features, dealing with errors, dealing with sending and receiving data, "Making things work" so to speak.</p>
<h3>My Skill's:</h3>
<p></p>
